Here’s the updated README section with the additional details:

Branching Strategy and Workflow

Branches Overview
• main: Stable production-ready code.
• develop: Main development branch for integrating new features and bug fixes.
• Feature Branches: For each task, component, or feature, create a new branch from develop using the naming pattern feature/\***\*, where \*\*** describes the work being done.

Creating a Feature Branch 1. Create a feature branch from develop:

git checkout -b feature/feature-description develop

Feature Flags
• Implement a feature flag for each new feature to control its activation.
• Use the feature flag in your code to toggle the feature on or off.

Component and Design Guidelines
• Reusable Components: Break down every part of the design into the smallest reusable components. This ensures a modular and maintainable codebase.
• Component UI Tests: Ensure that each component has corresponding UI tests to verify its visual correctness and behavior.
• API Integration Tests: For components that interact with APIs, implement integration tests to ensure that the API calls work as expected and handle responses correctly.

Pull Requests 1. Open a pull request (PR) to merge the feature/\*\*\*\* branch into develop. 2. Ensure the PR includes:
• A clear description of the feature or changes.
• References to related tasks or tickets.
• Evidence of testing, including component UI tests and API integration tests. 3. Request a code review and address any feedback provided. 4. Ensure all CI/CD checks pass before proceeding with further steps.

Additional Guidelines
• Commit Regularly: Make small, frequent commits to track progress.
• Stay Updated: Regularly pull changes from develop to keep your feature branch up-to-date.
• Manage Feature Flags: Periodically review and clean up unused feature flags.

This version includes the requirements for breaking down designs into reusable components, along with testing guidelines for UI and API integration, ensuring a robust development process.

commit style Here’s a short documentation example for developers to follow the correct commit message format:

Commit Message Guidelines

To ensure consistent and meaningful commit messages, please follow the Conventional Commits format:

<type>(<scope>): <subject>

    •	type: Describes the kind of change (e.g., feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore).
    •	scope: (Optional) Specifies the section of the codebase affected (e.g., auth, api, ui).
    •	subject: A concise description of the change.

Examples: 1. Feature Addition:

feat(api): add new endpoint for user login

    2.	Bug Fix:

fix(auth): resolve issue with JWT token validation

    3.	Documentation Update:

docs(readme): update installation instructions

Following this format helps in maintaining a clear and structured commit history.

Guidelines for Effective Commenting for sellticket frontend project

1. Component Purpose and Usage
   • What to Comment: At the start of each component file, briefly describe the component’s purpose and its role in the application.
   • Example:

/\*\*

- Header Component
- Renders the main navigation bar with links to primary sections of the site.
- Props:
- - user: Object containing user information for personalized greetings.
    \*/
    const Header = ({ user }) => {
    // Component implementation
    };

2. Complex Logic and Calculations
   • What to Comment: Explain intricate algorithms or calculations to help others understand the logic.
   • Example:

// Calculate the user's age based on their birthdate.
const calculateAge = (birthdate) => {
const today = new Date();
const birthDate = new Date(birthdate);
let age = today.getFullYear() - birthDate.getFullYear();
const monthDifference = today.getMonth() - birthDate.getMonth();
// Adjust age if the birth month hasn't occurred yet this year.
if (monthDifference < 0 || (monthDifference === 0 && today.getDate() < birthDate.getDate())) {
age--;
}
return age;
};

3. Conditional Rendering and Edge Cases
   • What to Comment: Justify the logic behind conditional renderings, especially for edge cases.
   • Example:

{
// Display admin panel link only for users with admin privileges.
user.isAdmin && (
<Link href="/admin">
<a>Admin Panel</a>
</Link>
)
}

4. API Calls and Data Fetching
   • What to Comment: Document the purpose of API calls, expected responses, and data utilization.
   • Example:

// Fetch list of articles from the API to display in the article list component.
useEffect(() => {
const fetchArticles = async () => {
try {
const response = await fetch('/api/articles');
const articles = await response.json();
setArticles(articles);
} catch (error) {
console.error('Error fetching articles:', error);
}
};
fetchArticles();
}, []);

5. Styling and CSS-in-JS
   • What to Comment: Explain complex styling decisions or theming logic when using styled-components or similar solutions.
   • Example:

// Styled button component with primary and secondary variants.
const StyledButton = styled.button`  background-color: ${(props) => (props.primary ? 'blue' : 'gray')};
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
  // Change background color on hover.
  &:hover {
    background-color: ${(props) => (props.primary ? 'darkblue' : 'darkgray')};
  }`;

6. Configuration Files and Environment Variables
   • What to Comment: Describe the purpose of specific settings in configuration files and the role of environment variables.
   • Example:

// next.config.js
module.exports = {
// Enable React Strict Mode for highlighting potential issues in the application.
reactStrictMode: true,
// Define environment variables accessible in the browser.
env: {
API_BASE_URL: 'https://api.example.com',
},
};

General Best Practices
• Clarity and Conciseness: Keep comments clear and to the point, avoiding unnecessary detail.
• Maintainability: Update comments regularly to match code changes, preventing outdated information.
• Avoid Redundancy: Focus on insights the code doesn’t convey, avoiding obvious statements.

TODO Comments
• Best Practices:
• Use TODO comments to mark unfinished tasks or areas needing improvement.
• Provide sufficient context within the TODO to clarify the task’s purpose and next steps.
	•	type: Describes the kind of change (e.g., feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore).
	•	scope: (Optional) Specifies the section of the codebase affected (e.g., auth, api, ui).
	•	subject: A concise description of the change.

Examples:
	1.	Feature Addition:

feat(api): add new endpoint for user login


	2.	Bug Fix:

fix(auth): resolve issue with JWT token validation


	3.	Documentation Update:

docs(readme): update installation instructions
