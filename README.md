Here’s the updated README section with the additional details:

Branching Strategy and Workflow

Branches Overview
	•	main: Stable production-ready code.
	•	develop: Main development branch for integrating new features and bug fixes.
	•	Feature Branches: For each task, component, or feature, create a new branch from develop using the naming pattern feature/****, where **** describes the work being done.

Creating a Feature Branch
	1.	Create a feature branch from develop:

git checkout -b feature/feature-description develop



Feature Flags
	•	Implement a feature flag for each new feature to control its activation.
	•	Use the feature flag in your code to toggle the feature on or off.

Component and Design Guidelines
	•	Reusable Components: Break down every part of the design into the smallest reusable components. This ensures a modular and maintainable codebase.
	•	Component UI Tests: Ensure that each component has corresponding UI tests to verify its visual correctness and behavior.
	•	API Integration Tests: For components that interact with APIs, implement integration tests to ensure that the API calls work as expected and handle responses correctly.

Pull Requests
	1.	Open a pull request (PR) to merge the feature/**** branch into develop.
	2.	Ensure the PR includes:
	•	A clear description of the feature or changes.
	•	References to related tasks or tickets.
	•	Evidence of testing, including component UI tests and API integration tests.
	3.	Request a code review and address any feedback provided.
	4.	Ensure all CI/CD checks pass before proceeding with further steps.

Additional Guidelines
	•	Commit Regularly: Make small, frequent commits to track progress.
	•	Stay Updated: Regularly pull changes from develop to keep your feature branch up-to-date.
	•	Manage Feature Flags: Periodically review and clean up unused feature flags.

This version includes the requirements for breaking down designs into reusable components, along with testing guidelines for UI and API integration, ensuring a robust development process.

commit style Here’s a short documentation example for developers to follow the correct commit message format:

Commit Message Guidelines

To ensure consistent and meaningful commit messages, please follow the Conventional Commits format:

<type>(<scope>): <subject>

	•	type: Describes the kind of change (e.g., feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore).
	•	scope: (Optional) Specifies the section of the codebase affected (e.g., auth, api, ui).
	•	subject: A concise description of the change.

Examples:
	1.	Feature Addition:

feat(api): add new endpoint for user login


	2.	Bug Fix:

fix(auth): resolve issue with JWT token validation


	3.	Documentation Update:

docs(readme): update installation instructions



Following this format helps in maintaining a clear and structured commit history.
