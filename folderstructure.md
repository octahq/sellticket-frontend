Folder Breakdown
	1.	/app/:
	•	Purpose: Contains the primary logic of your Next.js application. It includes pages, layouts, and dynamic routes.
	•	How it connects to tests: The logic and page structures in this folder will be tested under /tests/ui/containers/ where components like HeroSection.tsx and Features.tsx are tested as part of larger page structures.
	2.	/components/:
	•	Purpose: Contains reusable UI components like buttons, headers, etc.
	•	How it connects to tests: All reusable components should have corresponding tests under /tests/ui/components/. For example, Button.tsx and Header.tsx will be tested in Button.test.tsx and Header.test.tsx respectively.
	3.	/containers/:
	•	Purpose: Contains container components that often combine multiple UI components into a section or page, managing more complex state or logic.
	•	How it connects to tests: Tests for these container components can be found under /tests/ui/containers/. Tests ensure the components render correctly and interact as expected, like in HomePage.test.tsx and AboutPage.test.tsx.
	4.	/hooks/:
	•	Purpose: Contains custom hooks, like useAuth and useFetch, used to manage state or data-fetching logic.
	•	How it connects to tests: Custom hooks should be tested in /tests/ui/hooks/. These tests validate that the hooks behave as expected in different scenarios, e.g., useAuth.test.ts or useFetch.test.ts.
	5.	/lib/:
	•	Purpose: This folder contains utility files, such as API helpers or other common logic.
	•	How it connects to tests: Tests for utility functions that interact with APIs should go under /tests/api/lib/. This ensures that functions like api.ts are tested for edge cases and proper API call handling.
	6.	/public/:
	•	Purpose: Holds static assets like images, icons, and other files.
	•	How it connects to tests: While this folder typically does not need testing, it’s important to ensure assets are served correctly. Any testing related to the public assets could be conducted by validating the paths or ensuring assets are loaded properly within UI tests.
	7.	/styles/:
	•	Purpose: Contains global CSS styles and component-specific styles.
	•	How it connects to tests: While styles themselves are not typically tested in isolation, UI tests under /tests/ui/ will indirectly verify if the styles are applied correctly, for example, by checking for visual changes when certain props or states are triggered.
	8.	/utils/:
	•	Purpose: Contains utility functions that are used throughout the app, such as formatting dates.
	•	How it connects to tests: Utility functions should have tests in /tests/ui/utils/. For instance, the formatDate.test.ts file will test various date formatting cases.
	9.	/features/:
	•	Purpose: Organized by app features, like authentication and dashboard.
	•	How it connects to tests: Each feature has its tests under /tests/api/features/. For example, authService.test.ts tests the backend service for user authentication, while dashboardService.test.ts ensures that API calls related to dashboard data function correctly.
	10.	/tests/:
	•	Purpose: Contains all tests, including UI and API tests.
	•	How it connects to other folders: This folder has been divided into two major subfolders: /ui/ and /api/, with further subcategories to organize tests for components, containers, hooks, utilities, features, and integrations. This clear separation allows for better maintainability and scalability.

Why This Folder Structure?
	1.	Clarity: Organizing tests based on their function (UI vs API) helps developers quickly locate the tests they need. UI-related tests are concerned with rendering, interaction, and user behavior, while API tests focus on backend integrations, services, and API responses.
	2.	Maintainability: As the project evolves, adding new features or modifying existing ones can be done in a modular way. Developers can keep UI and API tests separate, making them easier to update without affecting unrelated parts of the application.
	3.	Scalability: This structure accommodates future growth. New UI components or API integrations can be added without disrupting the test suite, and features can be isolated within their respective test folders.
