# Project Structure and Testing Documentation

This documentation outlines the folder structure of the project, detailing each folder's purpose and its connection to the testing process. The goal is to provide clarity on where different parts of the codebase and tests reside, making it easier for developers to navigate and extend the project.

## Folder Breakdown

### 1. `/app/`
- **Purpose**: Contains the primary logic of your Next.js application, including pages, layouts, and dynamic routes.
- **How it connects to tests**: The logic and page structures in this folder are tested under `/tests/ui/containers/` for container components like `HeroSection.tsx` and `Features.tsx`, ensuring the page structure renders and interacts correctly.

### 2. `/components/`
- **Purpose**: Contains reusable UI components like buttons, headers, etc.
- **How it connects to tests**: Each component has corresponding tests in `/tests/ui/components/`. For instance, `Button.tsx` and `Header.tsx` are tested in `Button.test.tsx` and `Header.test.tsx`, respectively.

### 3. `/containers/`
- **Purpose**: Contains container components that combine multiple UI components to create larger sections or pages.
- **How it connects to tests**: These components are tested under `/tests/ui/containers/`. Tests ensure proper rendering and interaction, such as `HomePage.test.tsx` and `AboutPage.test.tsx`.

### 4. `/hooks/`
- **Purpose**: Contains custom hooks like `useAuth` and `useFetch` that manage state or data-fetching logic.
- **How it connects to tests**: Custom hooks are tested in `/tests/ui/hooks/`, verifying their behavior in different scenarios (e.g., `useAuth.test.ts` and `useFetch.test.ts`).

### 5. `/lib/`
- **Purpose**: Contains utility files, such as API helpers or common logic.
- **How it connects to tests**: API-related utilities are tested in `/tests/api/lib/`, ensuring proper API interactions, such as `api.ts`.

### 6. `/public/`
- **Purpose**: Holds static assets like images and icons.
- **How it connects to tests**: Although this folder generally doesn't require direct testing, UI tests will indirectly check that assets are loaded properly (e.g., by validating image paths).

### 7. `/styles/`
- **Purpose**: Contains global CSS styles and component-specific styles.
- **How it connects to tests**: While styles aren't typically tested in isolation, UI tests in `/tests/ui/` validate that components display correctly, ensuring that styles are applied as intended.

### 8. `/utils/`
- **Purpose**: Contains utility functions used throughout the app.
- **How it connects to tests**: Utility functions like `formatDate.ts` are tested in `/tests/ui/utils/`, ensuring correct functionality across different cases (e.g., `formatDate.test.ts`).

### 9. `/features/`
- **Purpose**: Organized by app features, like authentication and dashboard.
- **How it connects to tests**: Each feature has its API tests under `/tests/api/features/`. For example, `authService.test.ts` ensures the backend authentication service functions correctly, and `dashboardService.test.ts` validates API interactions for dashboard data.

### 10. `/tests/`
- **Purpose**: Contains all test files, including both UI and API tests.
- **How it connects to other folders**: The `/tests/` folder is split into two major subfolders: `/ui/` and `/api/`. Tests for components, containers, hooks, and utilities are placed in the `ui` folder, while tests for API interactions, features, and integrations reside in the `api` folder. This clear separation simplifies test management and navigation.

## Why This Folder Structure?

### 1. **Clarity**:
   - By organizing tests based on their function (UI vs API), developers can easily locate the tests they need. UI-related tests focus on rendering, interaction, and user behavior, while API tests ensure backend integrations and service functionality work as expected.

### 2. **Maintainability**:
   - As the project evolves, you can add or modify features and tests in a modular way. Keeping UI and API tests separate ensures that updates to one area won't affect the other, making maintenance simpler.

### 3. **Scalability**:
   - This structure allows the application to grow without disrupting the test suite. New UI components, API integrations, or features can be added easily within their respective test folders, facilitating seamless expansion.

## Conclusion

This structured approach to organizing the project and its tests will enhance clarity, maintainability, and scalability as your application grows. By keeping UI and API tests separate, you make it easier for developers to contribute and for the test suite to evolve alongside the app.

Adopting this folder structure will also improve your development workflow, ensuring that features and components are tested thoroughly and efficiently.
